# Simple DIY Smart home
This repository contains everything you need to make your own inexpensive smart home devices that integrate with [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/). This means no cloud! Everything works locally and you are in full control.
Don't be mistaken: DIY does not mean mediocre. By following this guide, you can build your own army of smart switches, dimmers, receptacles that not only work, but also look great.
Did I mention it's cheap?

## Requirements
Although it's super easy to follow this guide and make something, it is only true if you have certain equipment, parts and skills. Here's what you need:
 - A 3D printer capable of printing ABS and basic slicing/printing skills. A friend with a printer will do too!
 - A soldering iron (+consumables) and some basic soldering skills. Some fine soldering skills might be needed for more advanced devices.
 - Some basic tools: screwdriver, knife, sidecutters, etc.
 - Parts to perform the mods: switches, wires, LEDs, resistors, etc.
 - Positive attitude.

## Let's go!
1. Sourcing tools
2. Sourcing components
3. Sourcing smart devices
4. Printing parts
5. Assembling it together

All the things I share are always free.
However, making them available (organizing, documenting, etc.) takes a lot of time. So, if you like what I'm doing please consider supporting me. Only if you can! If you struggle to pay your bills, please don't donate.
