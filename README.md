# Simple DIY Smart home
This repository contains everything you need to make your own inexpensive smart home devices that integrate with [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/). This means no cloud! Everything works locally and you are in full control.<br>
Don't be mistaken: DIY does not mean mediocre. By following this guide, you can build your own army of smart switches, dimmers, receptacles that not only work, but also look great. Did I mention it's cheap?

## Why DIY?
Converting your entire house into a smart home is really expensive. I'd say it is cost-prohibitive for most of the people. While having 2-3-4 lights or switches automated is cool, having the entire house under control is way better. Making not cloud-dependent is even better. This way you don't have to give away your information, create new accounts, manage those passwords. Also, your devices are controlled by your computer, so you are in charge. And of course, there is this pride you feel when you make something.

## Disclaimer
Making and installing these devices will expose you to hot soldering iron, fumes from flux, dangerous mains voltage, etc. This may harm your health, kill you, and burn your house down. By following this guide you agree to do so at your own risk.
This is not to discourage or to deter you. I'm not one of those who say "*if you don't feel comfortable doing it, leave it to the professional*", in fact I oppose this phrase, because if you don't push yourself beyond what's comfortable, you'll never learn to do these uncomfortable things. In my opinion it goes against DIY, so I encourage you to dive in the unknown and try to do what you've never done before. Just be aware of the risks.
