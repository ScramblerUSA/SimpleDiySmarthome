# Simple DIY Smart home
This repository contains everything you need to make your own inexpensive smart home devices that integrate with [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/). This means no cloud! Everything works locally and you are in full control.<br>
Don't be mistaken: DIY does not mean mediocre. By following this guide, you can build your own army of smart switches, dimmers, receptacles that not only work, but also look great. Did I mention it's cheap?

## Why DIY?
Converting your entire house into a smart home is really expensive. I'd say it is cost-prohibitive for most of the people. While having 2-3-4 lights or switches automated is cool, having the entire house under control is way better. Making not cloud-dependent is even better. This way you don't have to give away your information, create new accounts, manage those passwords. Also, your devices are controlled by your computer, so you are in charge. And of course, there is this pride you feel when you make something.

## Requirements
Although it's super easy to follow this guide and make something, it is only true if you have certain equipment, parts and skills. Here's what you need:
 - A 3D printer (preferably capable of printing ABS) and basic slicing/printing skills. A friend with a printer will do too!
 - A soldering iron (+consumables) and some basic soldering skills. Some fine soldering skills might be needed for more advanced devices.
 - Some basic tools: screwdriver, knife, drill, sidecutters, etc.
 - Parts to perform the mods: switches, wires, LEDs, resistors, etc.
 - Positive attitude.

All the things I share are always free.
However, making them available (organizing, documenting, etc.) takes a lot of time. So, if you like what I'm doing please consider supporting me. Only if you can! If you struggle to pay your bills, please don't donate.
